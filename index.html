              a 19 year old aspiring web developer that lives in a small village
              called Wimblington in Cambridgeshire. Studying and achieving a
              Distintion for my IT A-level last year, I gained a passion for
              wanting to pursue a career in the software tech industry.

            <p>
              I'm diligent and motivated who always strives to continuously
              learn something new and to improve myself mentally and physically.
              Being a huge optimist, I always seek spreading positivity in
              everything amongst myself and others.

              When I am not coding, I enjoy playing rugby for my local team and
              to help coach the under 10's team every weekend. When I was 14, I
              was scouted for the Cambridgeshire Rugby Development Programme for
              Northampton Saints Rugby Club. From this, I competed in an Eastern
              Counties tournament for Cambridgeshire U15 at Franklins Garden,
              Northampton Saints stadium. I also enjoy reading books that will
              help improve my mindset and hear about people's life stories. My
              favourite book I've read is called 'The Secret' as I'm a big
              believer of the Law of Attraction. Spending time with my friends
              and family is hugely important to me as it sees me at my happiness
              and provides me with a sense of security, support, and love.

            <p>
              In the future, I would love to travel across the world and visit
              as many countries as I can. Embracing different cultures,
              accomplish life-changing experiences and going on a new adventure
              everytime creating memories to cherish.

            <p>
              Over a year ago, I was introduced to a senior full-stack developer
              who told me about his experience and career in web development and
              how I could make a career from it too.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              He introduced me to the Frontend Codecademy course and a developer
              roadmap which I am treating like a job until completion, knowing
              I'm close to nailing the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and now
              making a start on React, I have confidence in myself to be able
              build a strong responsive and interactive Frontend website.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I can't wait to make a start on the Founders & Coders course to
              make the next big step in my web development career path. The
              opportunity to learn full-stack web development and to gain
              real-world experience sounds amazing to me. I am fully committed
              to achieving my dream of becoming a senior full-stack web
              developer.
