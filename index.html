        Over a year ago, I was introduced to a senior full-stack developer who
        told me about his experience and career in web development and how I
        could make a career from it too.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        He introduced me to the Frontend Codecademy course and a developer
        roadmap which I am treating like a job until completion, knowing I'm
        close to nailing the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and now making a
        start on React, I have confidence in myself to be able build a strong
        responsive and interactive Frontend website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I can't wait to make a start on the Founders & Coders course to make the
        next big step in my web development career path. The opportunity to
        learn full-stack web development and to gain real-world experience
        sounds amazing to me. I am fully committed to achieving my dream of
        becoming a senior full-stack web developer. I belive FAC
