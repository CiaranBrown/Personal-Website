              <p>
                a 19 year old aspiring web developer that lives in a small
                village called Wimblington in Cambridgeshire. Studying and
                achieving a Distintion for my IT A-level last year, I gained a
                passion for wanting to pursue a career in the software tech
                industry.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I'm diligent and motivated who always strives to continuously
                learn something new and to improve myself mentally and
                physically. Being a huge optimist, I always seek spreading
                positivity in everything amongst myself and others.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                When I am not coding, I enjoy playing rugby for my local team
                and to help coach the under 10's team every weekend. When I was
                14, I was scouted for the Cambridgeshire Rugby Development
                Programme for Northampton Saints Rugby Club. From this, I
                competed in an Eastern Counties tournament for Cambridgeshire
                U15 at Franklins Garden, Northampton Saints stadium. I also
                enjoy reading books that will help improve my mindset and hear
                about people's life stories. My favourite book I've read is
                called 'The Secret' as I'm a big believer of the Law of
                Attraction. Spending time with my friends and family is hugely
                important to me as it sees me at my happiness and provides me
                with a sense of security, support, and love.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In the future, I would love to travel across the world and visit
                as many countries as I can. Embracing different cultures,
                accomplish life-changing experiences and going on a new
                adventure everytime creating memories to cherish.

              <p>
                I have always wanted a career in the IT industry since leaving
                secondary school but wasn't sure what sector to choose. I've
                always found the idea of building websites fascinating so
                decided to research about how it happens, developing a dream of
                becoming a full-stack developer along the way. Over a year ago,
                I was introduced to a senior full-stack developer who told me
                about his experience and career in web development and how I
                could make a career from it too.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                He introduced me to the Frontend Codecademy course and a
                developer roadmap which I am treating like a job until
                completion, knowing I'm close to nailing the basics of HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript and now making a start on React, I have
                confidence in myself to be able build a strong responsive and
                interactive Frontend website.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I can't wait to make a start on the Founders & Coders course to
                make the next big step in my web development career path. The
                opportunity to learn full-stack web development and to gain
                real-world experience sounds amazing to me. I am fully committed
                to achieving my dream of becoming a senior full-stack web
                developer.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I feel like Founders and Coders is the right place for me to
                train because I was advised to take this course by a senior
                full-stack web developer which I met who also introduced me to a
                Frontend coding bootcamp course over a year ago. Founders and
                Coders are providing a fantastic opportunity which I am fully
                committed to reaching the next big step in achieving my dream of
                becoming a full-stack web developer. I will contribute by
                bringing a positive and supportive attitude towards everyone
                involved in the Founders and Coders community so everyone feels
                safe and in high spirits.
