          <p>
            Since leaving sixth form last year, I have always wanted to pursue a
            career in the IT industry and have always found the idea of building
            websites fascinating. 10 months ago, I met a senior full-stack
            developer who told me about his experience and career in web
            development and how I could make a career from it too.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            He introduced me to the Frontend Codecademy course and a developer
            roadmap which I am treating like a job until completion, knowing I'm
            close to nailing the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and now making
            a start on React, I have confidence in myself to be able build a
            strong responsive and interactive Frontend website.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            I can't wait to make a start on the Founders & Coders course to make
            the next big step in my web development career path. The opportunity
            to learn full-stack web development and to gain real-world
            experience sounds amazing to me. I am fully committed to achieving
            my dream of becoming a senior full-stack web developer.
